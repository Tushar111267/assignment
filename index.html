        <p>Food is a basic necessity for survival and also the 
            key to a healthy life. Without regular healthy meals children struggle to go to school, 
                carers struggle to work and communities are left battling to survive.</p>

        <h1>Shelter For a Family</h1>

            Their are so many causes of homelessness that are common in many people's lives.</p>

        <h1>Education For a Children </h1>
        <p>Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to employment and earning potential later in life. They are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to participate in decisions that 
            affect them </p>
